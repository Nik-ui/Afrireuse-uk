# AfriReuse UK 

**AfriReuse UK** is a community-driven digital platform designed to enable structured, safe, and transparent reuse of household items through a donor–recipient workflow system.

Unlike traditional listing platforms that operate as simple post-and-message marketplaces, AfriReuse UK introduces a **process-oriented reuse lifecycle** ,from item listing to request validation, pickup scheduling, dispute handling, and completion tracking.

##  Problem Statement

Across the UK, thousands of reusable household items are discarded daily due to:

- Lack of structured reuse systems  
- Safety concerns between strangers  
- Poor coordination of pickups  
- Unverified item availability  
- Untracked handover processes  

Existing platforms primarily support **unstructured peer-to-peer messaging**, leading to:

- Missed pickups  
- Ghosting  
- Item hoarding  
- Fraud  
- Poor accountability  

---

##  Solution Overview

AfriReuse UK introduces:

- Role-based user flows (Donor, Recipient, Admin)  
- Request validation and time-bound approvals  
- Pickup scheduling and confirmation system  
- Item state lifecycle tracking  
- Dispute resolution workflow  
- Admin moderation and analytics  

The platform focuses on **trust, accountability, and operational clarity**, not just listings.
